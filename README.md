Jenkins Shared Library
================================

## Overview

This repository contains the shared library for Jenkins pipelines used across different projects. The shared library provides a set of reusable functions and utilities that simplify the creation and maintenance of Jenkins pipelines. It promotes code reuse and standardizes our CI/CD processes.

## How to Use the Shared Library

To use the shared library in your Jenkins pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Configure Jenkins

   Ensure that your Jenkins instance is properly configured to use shared libraries. Check that the "my-shared-library" is set up as a global shared library in Jenkins.

2. Import the Shared Library

   In your Jenkinsfile, import the shared library at the top of the script using the @Library annotation:

   @Library('my-shared-library') _

3. Use Shared Library Functions

   After importing the shared library, you can use its functions and utilities directly in your Jenkins pipeline. The shared library provides a set of predefined steps and functions to simplify common tasks such as versioning, deployment, and notifications.

   For example, to use a function named myCustomStep from the shared library:

```jenkinsfile
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   myCustomStep('Build something') // Call the custom function from the  shared library
               }
           }
           // Add more stages as needed...
       }
       // Post actions and other pipeline configurations...
   }
```

4. Library Documentation

   Detailed documentation for each function and utility available in the shared library can be found in the "docs" directory of this repository. Please refer to the documentation to understand the parameters and usage of each function.
